Although microfluidic technologies are widely used for reliable nanoparticle synthesis, they face chal -\\nlenges in meeting critical homogeneity requirements, mainly due to imperfect mixing efficiency. Furthermore, \\nchannel clogging during continuous operation presents a significant obstacle in terms of quality control, as it \\nprogressively impedes the mixing behavior necessary for consistent nanoparticle production for therapeutic \\ndelivery and complicates the scaling-up process. This study entailed the development of a 3D-printed novel \\nmicromixer embedded with hemispherical baffle microstructures, a dual vortex mixer (DVM), which integrates \\nDean vortices to generate two symmetrical counter-rotating intensified secondary flows. The DVM with a rela -\\ntively large mixer volume showed rapid mixing characteristics even at a flow rate of several mL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nand \\nproduced highly uniform lipids, liposomes, and polymer nanoparticles in a size range (50 – 130 nm) and poly -\\ndispersity index (PDI) values below 0.15. For the evaluation of products, SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA-loaded lipid \\nnanoparticles were examined to verify protein expression in vitro and in vivo using firefly luciferase (FLuc) \\nmRNA. This showed that the performance of the system is comparable to that of a commercial toroidal mixer. \\nMoreover, the vigorous in-situ dispersion of nanoparticles by harnessing the power of vortex physically mini -\\nmizes the occurrence of aggregation, ensuring consistent production performance without internal clogging of a \\nhalf-day operation and facilitating quality control of the nanoparticles at desired scales.   \\n1. Introduction \\nNanotechnology has attracted considerable attention in the field of \\ndrug delivery owing to its advantages such as specific cell targeting, \\nenhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, and reduced cytotox -\\nicity, overcoming the limitations of conventional delivery methods by \\nhandling biological barriers in organs [ 1 – 3 ]. To maximize consistent \\ntherapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects, precise control of their \\nsize is critical, as deviations from the target size can lead to toxicity due \\nto accumulation in undesired organs or cells depending on the specific \\ndisease and target organ [ 4 – 6 ]. In pursuit of these objectives, the \\napplication of microfluidics has emerged as an indispensable approach \\nthat meets complex requirements and new demands owing to its high \\nmass transfer and precise process control [ 7 , 8 ]. \\nHowever, continuous nanoparticle production via a microfluidic \\nmixer poses challenges for solution mixing and has implications for the \\naggregation and consistency of physicochemical properties [ 9 , 10 ]. Due \\nto material vulnerabilities and structural limitations, the micromixers \\nproposed thus far face challenges in maintaining consistent mixing \\nperformance or the use of either high anti-solvent to good-solvent ratios \\n( > 10), or high industrial flow rates over ~10\\n1 \\nmL min\\n\\x00 1\\n. In addition, \\ngradual channel deformation and clogging due to the surface adhesion \\nof the precursors make it infeasible to produce uniformly over a long \\nperiod of time [ 11 – 13 ]. As for the manufacturing technology of the \\nmicromixer, conventional photolithography or injection molding tech -\\nniques suffer from the narrow availability of suitable resins, most of \\nwhich have low solvent resistance. These subtractive manufacturing \\nprocesses make it difficult to implement complex and three-dimensional \\n* Corresponding authors. \\nE-mail addresses: joosung.yang@stpharm.co.kr (J.-S.

On the other hand, 3D-printing is a prom -\\nising alternative as the additive manufacturing process is easy to \\nconstruct the desired monolithic structures using sophisticated design \\nconcepts. However, it is still not easy to manufacture a small volumetric \\nmixer with high resolution; therefore, bulky channels with large di -\\nmensions are generally fabricated. In this case, expensive precursor re -\\nagents are inevitably consumed when a high mixing efficiency is feasible \\nonly under high flow rates [ 16 – 18 ]. \\nIt is well known that baffle structures inside the mixer induce sec -\\nondary flows and improve mixing efficiency [ 19 – 21 ]. However, the \\nwidely used 2D baffle is prone to cause nanoparticles to adhere to the \\ncorner as a structural dead volume, which gradually degrades the per -\\nformance of the mixer, including the inner flow pressure, along with \\nusage time [ 11 , 22 ]. Accordingly, nanoparticle properties may be uneven \\nin terms of time dependence. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new \\nconcept for a micromixer that enables ultrafast mixing at low flow rates \\nand facilitates the control of the desired production scale without \\nchannel clogging, even during long-term operation. In addition, to use \\nthe newly developed mixer in practice, it is essential to thoroughly verify \\nthe preliminary performance of the produced functional nanoparticles. \\nRecently, mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) as a \\nCovid-19 vaccine have significantly contributed to the promotion of \\nhuman health during the pandemic [ 23 , 24 ]. Gene therapy has emerged \\nas an innovative approach for the prevention and treatment of various \\ndiseases [ 25 – 27 ]. In these cases, it should not be overlooked that ac -\\ncurate investigation of protein expression enables various applications, \\nin addition to excellent intracellular delivery efficiency and low \\nimmunogenicity. The developed mixers demonstrate an early stage of \\nparticle manufacturing capability [ 10 , 18 , 28 , 29 ]. Few studies have \\ninvestigated the efficacy of nanoparticles produced in vivo and in vitro \\nin comparison to those produced using one of commercial micromixers, \\nthe toroidal mixer (NanoAssemblr Ignite). Thus, beyond the evaluation \\nof physical properties after synthesizing nanoparticles using a mixer, it is \\nessential to accurately confirm the in vitro and in vivo efficacy to un -\\nderstand the pharmacological profile. \\nHerein, we present a new conceptual micromixer embedded with 3D \\nhemispherical baffle structures, called a dual vortex mixer (DVM), \\nwhich was designed using a thorough computational fluid dynamics \\n(CFD) simulation and then fabricated using a 3D-printer ( Scheme 1 ). \\nThe DVM, with a length of only 3.9 mm of 3 baffles, enables ultrafast \\nmixing within a few milliseconds at total flow rates of several mL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nwith low anti-solvent ratio by inducing two symmetric vortices of \\nextensive intensity ( Fig. 1 D and Fig. S1), thereby bridging the \\noperational gap between microfluidic mixers. Highly uniform polymeric \\nnanoparticles, liposomes, and mRNA-LNPs with sizes below 100 nm and \\na PDI value below 0.1 were produced across a wide range of concen -\\ntrations and throughput. With respect to mRNA-LNPs, the DVM \\ndemonstrated an equivalent performance to a commercial toroidal \\nmixer by fully investigating the protein expression in vitro through \\nSARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA as well as in vivo tests using FLuc mRNA. \\nInterestingly, minimal dead volume in the DVM platform with the round \\ncorners of the hemispherical baffles, and the strong swirling effect \\nprovides vigorous dispersion of the as-synthesized nanoparticles, \\nretaining uniform production of particles even during 12 h of nonstop \\noperation. Experimentally, the clogging is approximately 179 times \\nlower than that of a commercial toroidal mixer. Based on the full-cycle \\nstudy, this new platform potentially serves as a versatile tool for nano -\\ncarrier production, both at laboratory scale and in parallelized scaled-up \\nsystems for industrial production. \\n2.

For the two-piece assembly type of \\nmicromixer, the monolithic device as aforementioned was divided into \\ntwo halves, and each part was designed separately. After printing, the \\ntwo components were placed on a stainless-steel metal frame secured \\nwith screws. \\n2.3. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of micromixers \\nNumerical CFD studies were conducted to evaluate the degree of \\nmixing, TKE, and dead volume inside the baffles. Fluid flow within a \\nmicromixer can be described by the Navier – Stokes equation, species- \\ntransport equation, and the mass-conversion equation. To select the \\nappropriate viscous model, the maximum Reynolds number was calcu -\\nlated for the baffle section between the structures with the smallest areas \\non each virtual device. The density and viscosity of the water-ethanol \\nmixture based on the total flow rate and the flow rate ratio were \\ncalculated as follows: \\nρ\\nmixture\\n=\\n∑\\ni\\nv\\ni\\nρ\\ni\\n∑\\ni\\nv\\ni\\nμ\\nmixture\\n=\\n∑\\ni\\nx\\ni\\nμ\\ni  \\nwhere ρ\\nmixture \\nand μ\\nmixture \\nare the density and viscosity of the water- \\nethanol mixture, and v\\ni\\n, ρ\\ni \\nand x\\ni \\nrepresent the volume fraction, den -\\nsity and mole fraction of component i , respectively. The hydraulic \\ndiameter in the baffle section were calculated as follows: \\nd\\nh\\n=\\n4 A\\nd .\\nwhere d\\nh \\nis hydraulic diameter of baffle, and A and d are the cross- \\nsectional area, and perimeter of the baffle. \\nAs the Reynolds numbers are varied from laminar to transition re -\\ngion depends on the total flow rate, shear-stress transport (SST) k – ω \\nstandard turbulence model which merged k – ε turbulence and k – ω tur -\\nbulence models was used for calculation [ 30 , 31 ]. Assuming a steady \\nstate, the governing equation for fluid flow can be simplified as follows: \\nρ v • ∇ v = \\x00 ∇ p + μ ∇\\n2\\nv + ρ g: Navier – Stokes equation \\n∇ • v = 0: Mass-conversion equation \\n∇ • ( ρ v Y\\ni\\n) = \\x00 ρ D\\ni\\n∇ Y\\ni\\n: Species-transport equation \\nwhere ρ is the fluid density, v is the fluid linear velocity, p is the \\npressure, μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity, g is the gravitational accel -\\neration, and Y\\ni \\nis the mass fraction of each species i . Molecular diffu -\\nsivity of 1.23 × 10\\n\\x00 9 \\nm\\n2 \\ns\\n\\x00 1 \\nwas used for D\\ni\\n. The governing equations \\nwere solved with appropriate boundary conditions (no-slip boundary \\nconditions on the channel walls, mass flow rate for the inlets, outflow \\nconditions for the outlets, and zero normal gradients for all flow vari -\\nables except pressure). The equations were discretized based on the \\nfinite volume method, and the commercial numerical software FLUENT \\n2022 R2 (ANSYS, Inc.) was used for numerical simulation. The density \\nand viscosity of ethyl alcohol (790 kg m\\n3\\n, 0.0012 kg m\\n\\x00 1 \\ns\\n\\x00 1\\n) and water \\n(998.2 kg m\\n3\\n, 0.001003 kg m\\n\\x00 1 \\ns\\n\\x00 1\\n) were used for fluid properties. The \\nportion of the computational domain which the velocity magnitude fell \\nbelow 5% of the maximum velocity at a given time was labelled as dead \\nvolume [ 32 , 33 ].

POPC and cholesterol were dissolved in ethanol at a total con -\\ncentration of 10 mg mL\\n\\x00 1 \\nand a molar ratio of 55:45 [ 35 ]. The lipid \\nsolution and an aqueous buffer (saline, 154 mM NaCl) were injected into \\nthe lipid and antisolvent inlets, respectively. Self-assembled POPC li -\\nposomes were collected from the outlet stream resulting from the mixing \\nof two adjacent streams and dialyzed overnight using dialysis sacks \\n(MWCO 12,000 Da , Sigma-Aldrich) against 1000 times the buffer (10 \\nmM PBS, pH 7.4) to remove the residual ethanol. \\n2.7.

In summary, the \\noutlet of the toroidal mixer cartridge was connected to 1/16 ” PTFE \\ntubing, and this tubing was connected to a syringe through a 19G needle, \\nwhich was subsequently attached to a syringe pump. The syringe pump \\nwas operated at a rate of 0.05 μ L min\\n\\x00 1\\n, and the residence time was \\ncalculated by visually confirming the point at which the first structure \\nbegan to fill with the fluid until the last structure was completely filled. \\nThe final volume of the toroidal mixer ’ s internal structure was computed \\nas an average of three independent measurements. \\n2.10. Comparative formulation and concentration of DVM-LNPs and \\ntoroidal-LNPs \\nFor the formulation of DVM-LNPs and Toroidal-LNPs, a lipid solution \\n(3.2 mg mL\\n\\x00 1\\n) and mRNA solution were mixed at the same component \\nand mass ratios, as aforementioned. A flow rate of 3 mL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nfor the \\nlipid solution and 9 mL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nfor the buffer solution, commonly used for \\nthe operation of commercial toroidal mixers (Ignite, Ignite Dilution), \\nwas employed for both devices. When PBS dilution was performed \\nimmediately after formulation, LNPs were diluted at a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio \\nwith PBS using a T-mixer in the case of the DVM, or an Ignite Dilution \\ncartridge with 3 inlets was used. To achieve a complete buffer envi -\\nronment, a centrifugal filter device (Amicon ® Ultra-15, Merck Milli -\\npore) was used for diafiltration. Briefly, the purified samples were \\nplaced inside the unit, the remaining space was filled with buffer, and \\ncentrifugation was repeated at 3500 rpm for 40 min until the pH of the \\nsolution outside the membrane reached 7.4. For in vitro use, LNP loaded \\nwith SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA was diluted to achieve a concentration of \\n0.08 mg mL\\n\\x00 1 \\nof mRNA. For in vivo applications, LNP loaded with FLuc \\nmRNA underwent the same purification process, and the final concen -\\ntration of the mRNA was set at 0.10 mg mL\\n\\x00 1\\n. \\n2.11. In vitro spike mRNA protein expression \\nHEK 293 T cells (ATCC, American Type Culture Collection) were \\ncultured at a density of 1 × 10\\n6 \\ncells/well for Western blot analysis. \\nSamples containing SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA, including DVM-LNPs and \\nToroidal-LNPs, were dispersed in Opti-MEM (Reduced-Serum Medium, \\nGibco ™ ) and treated with 3 μ g of mRNA-LNP complex per well. Spike \\nprotein expression was measured after 24 h of incubation. Following \\ntransfection, each well was treated with sterile PBS and 200 uL of lysate \\ncomplex (Cell Lysis Buffer, Invitrogen ™ ), followed by incubation at \\nroom temperature for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 \\nrpm for 10 min before collection for analysis. \\n2.12. Western blot \\nCell extracts were separated by 4 – 15% gradient SDS-PAGE (4 – 15% \\nMini-PROTEAN TGX ™ Precast Protein Gels, Bio-Rad). The cell lysate \\nproteins were transferred from the gel to a 0.2 μ m PVDF membrane \\n(Mini-format, Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted with Recombinant 2019- \\nnCoV Spike antibody (SARS-COV-2 Spike RBD Polyclonal Antibody, \\nElabscience) and GAPDH antibody (sc-47,724, Santa cruz Biotech -\\nnology).

In vivo luciferase protein expression \\nMale BALB/c mice weighing between 22 and 25 g were randomly \\ndivided into seven groups ( n = 3 per group). These groups included a \\nnegative control group treated with PBS, three groups treated with FLuc \\nmRNA-containing DVM-LNPs, and three groups treated with Toroidal- \\nLNPs. Each group was administered a volume of 50 μ L (containing 5 \\nμ g of mRNA) into the right quadriceps muscle of the mice. Body weight \\nand bioluminescence of each mouse were measured at seven time points: \\npre-administration and 0.5, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 6 days post- \\nadministration. Prior to image acquisition, each mouse received 100 \\nμ L of luciferin (D-Luciferin, GoldBio) at a concentration of 15 mg mL\\n\\x00 1 \\ninto the abdominal cavity on both sides, followed by imaging using an \\nIVIS Spectrum (PerkinElmer, USA) at the specified time points. After \\nacquiring images over a period of six days, a region of interest (ROI) was \\ndefined around the injection site, and the total flux value was calculated. \\n2.14. Long-term operational test of the micromixers \\nThree assembly types of NVM, SVM, and DVM in addition to a \\ntransparent toroidal mixer were used for long-term production of \\nnanoparticles. The TPE, with a concentration of 1 mg mL\\n\\x00 1\\n, was dis -\\nsolved in acetone. Deionized water was used as the antisolvent for \\ncontinuous nanoparticle production. To prevent solvent evaporation, \\nthe beaker was sealed with parafilm and foil. An HPLC pump (PR-Class, \\nTeledyne SSI) was connected to a beaker of deionized water to allow \\ninjection at a high flow rate. Another HPLC pump (LC-10 CE; Shimadzu) \\nwas connected to the TPE solution. To connect to the toroidal mixer, the \\noutlets of the HPLC pumps were linked to 1/4 ” PTFE tubing using 316 \\nstainless steel reducers (SS-400-6-1BT, Swagelok). The end of each tube \\nwas further connected to a 3 mm Stainless Needle Luer-lock tubing \\nconnector (KT503s, Needle store) to fit into the inlet of the toroidal \\nmixer. The HPLC pumps were set to operate with a TPE solution flow \\nrate of 0.9 mL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nand a deionized water flow rate of 8.1 mL min\\n\\x00 1\\n. \\nThe pressure of the HPLC pump was continuously monitored in real time \\nduring operation to calculate the pressure difference. The resulting \\nnanoparticles from the outlet were collected in different vials for further \\nDLS analysis. \\n2.15. Visualization and quantification of channel clogging \\nAfter the completion of continuous operation (166 min for SVM, 120 \\nmin for NVM, 100 min for toroidal mixer, 166 min, and 12 h for DVMs) \\nas aforementioned, a flow of deionized water was injected through inlet \\nat 0.1 mL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nfor 1 min to flush out any remaining solutions without \\naffecting the clogged nanoparticle. Subsequently, the micromixers were \\ndried in an 80 \\n◦\\nC oven for 30 min to remove any residual water inside. \\nThe remaining particles inside were then visualized and quantified for \\nthe toroidal mixer. In the case of the 3D-printed micromixers, they were \\ndisassembled before visualization and quantification. For visualization, \\nthe toroidal mixer and the disassembled micromixers were placed under \\na fixed UV lamp (365 nm, approximately 100 mW cm\\n\\x00 2\\n) in a darkened \\nstate and observed under a microscope. As the intensity of the lumi -\\nnescence was not able to quantify directly, the clogged nanoparticles \\nwere dissolved using acetone and collected in vials for quantification. \\nThe quantity of nanoparticles was determined using a calibration curve \\nusing TPE in acetone with a wavelength of 330 nm. \\n3.

Second, the \\nuse of a round-structured channel with minimal dead volume, as \\nopposed to an angled structured channel, improves the mixing efficiency \\n[ 38 ] and facilitates long-term continuous operation [ 11 , 39 , 40 ]. Finally, \\nthe vortex generated inside the reactor further accelerates the mixing \\nand the dispersion of nanoparticles, preventing adhesion and agglom -\\neration [ 41 – 43 ]. \\nFor a 2D baffle with a constant channel height, secondary flow- \\nG.-S.

Semi-cylinder baffles did not induce a clear alteration in the \\ndirection of the fluid flow, thereby suppressing vortex formation [ 40 ]. In \\ncontrast, cubic baffles, owing to their angular structure, induced an \\nadditional flow perpendicular to the dominant flow axis, resulting in the \\nformation of a single vortex [ 21 ]. In this context, the fundamental \\nconcept of the new micromixer entails arranging baffle structures of 3D \\nhemispheres, consequently bestowing slightly altered micro-curvature \\nradii upon each fluid element during the three-dimensional flow \\nexpansion. Through this approach, coherent flows and Dean vortices are \\ninduced by the divergent and convergent discharge of fluid through \\nnarrow apertures, resulting in a diagonally symmetrical dual vortex \\nrelative to the primary flow. ( Fig. 1 A). \\nTo conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison of the mixer \\nstructures based on CFD simulations [ 44 ], we designed three virtual \\nchannel models, each including the injection zone and the outlet, and all \\nhaving the same volume and converging channel length ( Fig. 1 B). These \\nmodels consisted of a non-vortex mixer (NVM) with semi-cylinder baf -\\nfles, a single vortex mixer (SVM) with cubic baffles, and a DVM with \\nhemisphere baffles. Ethanol and water were selected to simulate the \\nmixing of two solutions used in lipid nanoparticle [ 15 , 18 , 28 , 45 ]. We \\nevaluated these micromixers based on their turbulent kinetic energy \\n(TKE), which is an indicator of vortex intensity [ 46 ], formation of dead \\nvolume within the baffles, and mixing efficiency over time. In general, \\nDVM showed remarkably enhanced secondary flow compared to SVM \\nand NVM. By implementing a strong TKE, minimizing dead volume, and \\nachieving the highest mixing efficiency, the hemispherical baffle struc -\\nture outperformed the other baffle structures (Table S1, and Fig. S1). To \\noptimize the DVM, we performed additional simulations with different \\nbaffle dimensions while maintaining a constant flow rate. A smaller \\nconverging channel improved the mixing performance owing to a \\nstronger fluid expansion without altering the residence time per struc -\\nture. The diverging channel not only influenced the expansion but also \\nimpacted the residence time per structure. Increasing the length of the \\ndiverging channel while keeping the converging channel constant re -\\nsults in a substantial increase in the time spent by each structure within a \\nsingle baffle [ 47 ]. Consequently, this led to a lower number of structures \\npassing through in the same timeframe, indicating a diminished mixing \\nefficiency. Conversely, with substantially decreased diverging channels, \\nthe potential for utilizing the Dean vortex through 3D expansion flow \\nwas limited [ 48 ]. Therefore, a diameter of 900 μ m was ultimately \\nselected, maximizing the combination of residence time for the overall \\nmixer volume and each structure individually (Table S2). The optimized \\nDVM achieved a TKE of 171 m\\n2 \\ns\\n\\x00 2\\n, exceeding the values of SVM and \\nNVM by > 3.2-fold and 41-fold, respectively, while also having a dead \\nvolume of 7.32 × 10\\n\\x00 3 \\nmm\\n\\x00 3\\n, which was less than half the size of the \\nother models ( Fig. 1 C). Through these turbulent effects, DVM exhibited \\nsignificantly superior mixing performance compared to SVM and NVM, \\nachieving a mixing degree of 99.3% in just 5 ms, surpassing the \\nrespective efficiencies of 93.2% and 85.5% ( Fig. 1 D). The detailed di -\\nmensions of the selected DVM device are shown in Fig. 1 E. Eventually, \\nthe flow rates forming symmetrical dual vortex were determined at \\ndifferent flow rate ratios (FRR = 3, 6, and 9). An ethanol flow rate ≥ 0.9 \\nmL min\\n\\x00 1 \\nat an FRR of 3 exhibited a distinct dual vortex that intensified \\nat higher FRRs and was used for experimental nanoparticle production \\n(Tables S3 to S5). The significantly lower specified flow conditions, \\ncompared to those used in general large-scale mixers produced using \\nfabrication techniques such as 3D-printing [ 16 , 18 , 49 ], effectively miti -\\ngate excessive solution consumption during the nanoparticle optimiza -\\ntion process. \\n3.2. 3D-printing of DVM and validation for chemical stability \\n3D-printing not only enables the facile fabrication of three- \\ndimensional structures but also the selective use of resins to achieve \\nhigh chemical stability in organic solvents used for manufacturing \\nnanoparticles after curing [ 50 , 51 ]. Digital light processing (DLP) \\nprinting is widely known for its high resolution and is therefore \\ncommonly used for the fabrication of microfluidic channels smaller than \\n1 mm. We selected a PMMA-based resin that exhibits negligible swelling \\nbehavior against several organic solvents including ethanol and acetone \\n[ 52 ], which is commonly applied in the production of nanoparticles for \\nmRNA delivery, and prevents device deformation under high-pressure \\nconditions. Using the selected resin, we were able to promptly fabri -\\ncate the entire structure of the DVM (45 min per device), including two \\nvertical sides of a 15 mm injection zone with microstructures and a 5 \\nmm outlet [ 53 ]. Accurate dimension of the device was verified by \\nprinting the channel cross-section exposed in half, and the lengths of the \\ndiverging and converging channels were measured through a micro -\\nscope, revealing average lengths of 880 μ m and 150 μ m, respectively \\n( Fig. 1 F). We further confirmed that the device fabricated with this resin \\nexhibited no leaching for even 12 h of long-term ethanol or DMF in -\\njection, as determined by gas chromatography (GC) analysis (Fig. S2). \\nTherefore, the device possesses the requisite mechanical and chemical \\nproperties for the continuous production of particles over an extended \\nperiod of time. \\n3.3. Production of nanoparticles for drug delivery \\nDVM is a versatile platform for the production of lipid- and polymer- \\nbased nanoparticles for drug delivery with high uniformity and \\ncontrollable sizes. To demonstrate the capabilities of this platform, we \\nsynthesized four distinct types of nanoparticles utilizing FDA-approved \\nmaterials, including polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly(ethylene gly -\\nco l)-b-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles, 1-palmi -\\ntoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes, and \\nmRNA-LNPs [ 23 , 54 ]. In general, upon diffusion mixing, it is often \\nchallenging to systematically control high concentration of precursors, \\nwhich can lead to the formation of bimodal peaks and a broadening of \\nthe size distribution. To illustrate control over a broad concentration \\nrange of precursors and process parameters for versatile nanoparticle \\nsynthesis, each organic phase was prepared under three different con -\\ncentration conditions, and the process parameters including the total \\nflow rate (TFR) and FRR was screened. Especially, PEG-PLGA was set up \\nto 50 mg mL\\n\\x00 1 \\nas a higher concentration than the reported [ 10 , 55 ]. By \\ndynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, highly reproducible nano -\\nparticles were generated at both cases with diameters ranging from 50 to \\n130 nm and PDI of < 0.15 ( Fig. 2 A to F). Furthermore, the size of each \\nnanoparticle tends to decrease as the FRR and TFR increase, and as the \\nconcentration of the precursor solution decreases. These results indicate \\nthat the relatively large-volume DVM with a submillimeter diameter \\nenables ultrafast mixing within the channel and demonstrates the ability \\nto systematically control high concentrations of precursors without the \\nformation of aggregated particles. \\nThe figure of merit (Q) values as the inverse of the product of lipo -\\nsome diameter (d) and PDI, i.e., Q = d\\n\\x00 1 \\nPDI\\n\\x00 1\\n, are used to evaluate the \\nperformance of the micromixer devices [ 18 ]. The DVM showed excep -\\ntionally high Q values ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 for POPC liposomes, \\nand substantially exceeded 0.15 for other nanoparticles at considerably \\nlow FRR < 10, ( Fig. 2 G to I). Notably, the reported works attained high Q \\nvalues of 0.4 at a much higher FRR condition upto 100 [ 18 ]. Under low \\nFRR conditions, the amount of antisolvent that needs to be removed is \\nreduced, thereby potentially simplifying and shortening the purification \\nprocess after nanoparticle production to facilitate exchange into an \\noptimal buffer environment for subsequent storage or evaluation [ 56 ]. \\nNext, upon generation of drug-loaded nanoparticles, it is necessary to \\nverify high encapsulation efficiency (EE) through efficient interactions \\nbetween the carrier and the therapeutic agent [ 8 ]. Accordingly, we \\nloaded FLuc mRNA into LNPs to measure their physicochemical prop -\\nerties. > 90% of FLuc mRNA was successfully encapsulated in each \\nsample while maintaining high uniformity, indicating that sufficient \\nelectrostatic attraction was generated between ionizable lipids and \\nG.-S.

[ 59 ]. The properties of the purified LNP samples were \\ncompared for in vitro and in vivo protein expression ( Table 1 ). \\nIn all cases, uniform LNPs with a size of approximately 75 – 95 nm and \\na maximum PDI of 0.10 were produced. The EEs were also above 90%. \\nConsidering the volume difference between the DVM and the toroidal \\ndevices, the fact that both LNPs exhibited similar physicochemical \\nproperties under the same flow condition demonstrates the broad \\napplicability of the DVM. Consecutively, the actual protein expression of \\nboth DVM-LNP and Toroidal-LNP were compared by treating to cells at \\nthe identical conditions and analyzed through Western blot, and showed \\nsimilar protein expression in the cell lysate ( Fig. 3 B and Fig. S4). \\nFor a comparative study of in vivo mRNA delivery for DVM-LNPs and \\nToroidal-LNPs, formulation conditions were maintained while altering \\nonly the mRNA component. For in vivo applications, no significant \\ndifferences in the properties were observed between the DVM-LNPs and \\nToroidal-LNPs. After intramuscular (IM) injections, comparison of \\nluminescence intensity over time showed comparable performance be -\\ntween groups with identical manufacturing processes, indicating uni -\\nform intensity. The highest level of luminescence similarity was \\nobserved in all the groups after 6 h. These luminescent phases persisted \\nfor 72 h and were completely gone after 144 h ( Fig. 3 C and D and \\nFig. S5). The results of bioluminescence over time showed equivalent \\nbiokinetic profiles and consistent mRNA delivery between DVM-LNPs \\nand Toroidal-LNPs [ 60 ]. In essence, our findings confirm that despite \\nits larger volume, the DVM platform exhibits precise processing capa -\\nbilities through robust system control, resulting in mRNA-LNP proper -\\nties similar to those of the commercially available toroidal mixer. \\n3.5. Long-term operation of the micromixer \\nIn the drug delivery industry, consistent nanoparticle properties are \\ncritical for quality control in continuous manufacturing over long pe -\\nriods of time. The main factor affecting reactor performance is the ag -\\ngregates that form inside the mixer during operation, which is the \\nstarting point for clogging [ 11 – 13 ]. To comparatively demonstrate the \\nperformance of DVM continuity, we constructed 3D-printed SVM, NVM, \\nand DVM devices as two-piece assemblies (Fig. S6) in addition to a \\ncommercial reactor, transparent toroidal mixer [ 15 ]. And four types of \\nmicromixers were used to view the blockage during continuous nano -\\nparticle manufacturing. In practice, continuous production of mRNA- \\nLNPs for long period is inefficient and unrealistic with its high cost for \\nquantifying/visualizing clogging within the channels. As an alternative, \\nwe chose to prepare fluorescent nanoparticles instead of mRNA-LNPs for \\nefficient analysis. However, conventional dyes such as FITCs emit \\nfluorescence in the molecular state in solution and are ineffective for \\nlong-term imaging and tracking, particularly when aggregated [ 61 , 62 ]. \\nTherefore, we used tetraphenylethylene (TPE), an aggregation-induced- \\nemission (AIE) molecule, for the clogging test. TPE allows us to observe \\nonly nanoparticles trapped inside the channel and overcomes the pho -\\ntoluminescence limitations associated with conventional FITCs [ 63 – 65 ]. \\nThe DVM precipitated highly uniform TPE nanoparticles with the \\nsmallest size of 77 nm when the FRR was increased to 9, followed by the \\ntoroidal mixer with 80 nm, the slow mixing SVM with 92 nm, and the \\nNVM with 95 nm ( Fig. 4 A and Fig. S7). Because the wetting behavior of \\nthe colloidal solution with TPE nanoparticles and the material of the \\nmixer may be different [ 66 ], the contact angles of the TPE nanoparticles \\non the toroidal reactor and the surface of the DVM were measured and \\nconfirmed the equivalent interaction (Fig. S8). \\nBased on the above experimental conditions, two High-performance \\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) pumps with real-time pressure mea -\\nsurement capabilities were used to inject the solution and monitor the \\npressure changes inside the micromixers (Fig. S9). Continuous DLS \\nanalysis was also performed to check the variation in nanoparticle \\nproperties in real time. For 3D-printed mixers, TPE nanoparticles with \\nconstant physical characteristics were created over a period of approx -\\nimately 1 h. However, the pressure difference in the SVM, NVM, and \\ntoroidal mixer increased to 454 psi and 266 psi, respectively, which \\ndramatically changed the particle properties ( Fig. 4 B and C and \\nFig. S10). Owing to this high pressure, leakage occurred in the assem -\\nbled SVM and NVM after 166 and 120 min of operation, respectively. In \\nthe case of the toroidal mixer, the same amount of clogging proved to be \\nmore fatal due to the small volume. Nanoparticles produced by the \\ntoroidal mixer exhibited a size of approximately 88 nm only after 30 \\nmin, which was around 10% larger than the initial size. After 100 min, \\nthe internal pressure of the toroidal mixer reached 254 psi. On the other \\nhand, the pressure differential in the DVM was limited to 15 psi (460 min \\nlater), and the pressure inside the mixer was again maintained near the \\ninitial level for a total of 12 h despite continuous pump operation. \\nMoreover, during continuous production of TPE nanoparticles for half a \\nday, the PDI remained constantly below 0.1, whereas the size varied up \\nto 5 nm. \\nAfter removing the leftover solution without affecting the clogged \\naggregates (until leakage from SVM and NVM, 100 min of toroidal \\nmixer, 166 min, and 12 h of DVM each), the micromixers were dis -\\nassembled for the further analysis. The degree of clogging in the \\nmicromixers was visualized using a microscope under UV irradiation \\n( Fig. 4 D and Fig. S11) [ 65 ]. A substantially larger luminescence in -\\ntensity was observed in the case of the SVM, NVM, and toroidal mixer, \\nespecially where the obstruction inside the reactor led to an increase in \\npressure. In contrast, the DVM showed negligible clogging with an \\noperating time of 166 min. Another DVM running for up to 12 h \\nexhibited luminosity at the local outlet section; however, the internal \\nchannels responsible for vortex generation showed significantly lower \\nluminosity than the other mixers. The remaining nanoparticle aggre -\\ngates inside the mixers were once again dissolved using acetone, and \\ntheir concentrations were quantified via UV – vis spectroscopy [ 67 ]. \\nWhen converted to nanoparticle weight, SVM, NVM, and the toroidal \\nmixer were 0.39 mg, 0.30 mg, and 0.10 mg, respectively. However, the \\nDVM operated for 166 min amounted to only 0.03 mg, while the one \\noperated for 12 h reached a mere 0.11 mg. Taking into consideration the \\ntotal volume of the inner microstructures, the similarly operated DVM \\nrevealed > 10 times less clogging compared to other types of baffles and \\nremarkable 179-fold lower clogging ratio compared to the toroidal \\nmixer ( Fig. 4 E and Fig. S12). This demonstrates that the relatively large \\nreactor volume made by 3D-printing can lower the effect of aggregating \\nnanoparticles in comparison to the toroidal mixer. In addition, based on \\nthe simulation results as aforementioned, the intensified vortex pre -\\nvented the formation of aggregates by dispersing the nanoparticles in \\nsitu. Overall, DVM has demonstrated the capability to continuously \\nproduce various types of nanoparticles with high uniformity and desired \\nsizes while minimizing property variations, serving as a foundational \\nstep towards scalability. \\nTable 1 \\nComparison of DVM and commercial toroidal mixers in the properties of purified \\nmRNA-LNP under the same formulation conditions.

Conclusion \\nIn summary, we developed a novel micromixer with a three- \\ndimensional structure, DVM, in response to the challenges faced by \\ntraditional microfluidic systems in therapeutic delivery, such as flow \\nrate range, clogging, and difficulty in scaling up. The DVM intensify \\nvortex, enabling rapid mixing and efficient nanoparticle dispersion at \\nflow rates of just a few mL min-1, thus mitigating the need for high flow \\nrates and reducing the risk of clogging. The 3D-printed device allows for \\nproduction of highly-uniform nanoparticles as a mRNA carrier across a \\nwide range of concentrations, and shows comparable performance to \\ncommercially available ‘Nanoassemblr Ignite ’ platform in terms of \\nprotein expression and biokinetic profiles. Furthermore, the DVM \\ndemonstrates negligible pressure changes during continuous operation, \\neven for 12 h, and its compact design facilitates potential for scalable \\nproduction through one-step 3D-printing. This innovation holds great \\npromise for enhancing nanoparticleproduction from laboratory research \\nto large-scale clinical applications. \\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\nGi-Su Na: Writing – original draft, Visualization, Validation, Soft -\\nware, Methodology, Data curation, Conceptualization.
